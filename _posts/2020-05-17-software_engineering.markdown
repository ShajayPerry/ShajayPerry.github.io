      Hello, my name is Sha-Jay Perry. Im completely new to coding, before this i had no background knowledge or any kind of idea of what coding might be, i'm sure some of you can relate. I was first introduced to this program through my mother who had a friend that was currently taking part in this program. I did a little research on what software engineering actually is and i was automatically drawn in. Developing programs and operating computer data definitley sounded like a challenge that i was up for! 
		 Before Flatiron, i was going to college to major in psychology. I changed my career path over 5 times! I went from wanting to be a music major to almost every different field in psychology. I also wanted to get into film production. For the past couple of years i've just been in a blank spot where I didnt know exactly what I wanted to do, I just know that I wanted to do something that would be around for an eternity, and I believe that computers and technology in general will continue to be present for a lifetime. 
		 Aside from software engineering I did decide to get into music on the side, I figured I didnt need to go to school for it. I decided to teach myself how to produce music and it worked out great. I have my own fan base and I was able to distribute my music on major platforms like Apple Music, Spotify, Tidal, and etc. I am also a Forex trader which is trading currencies, i'ts similar to trading stocks. I began trading last year and my journey has been amazing, i've learned so much about discipline through trading. I am very excited to add software engineering onto my list of "talents" as well as make it a career. As I am completing the first mile, I can already tell that this is something that I want to continue learning.
